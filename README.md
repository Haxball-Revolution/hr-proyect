<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

If you've come this far, you probably know the game HaxBall, a 2D multiplayer soccer game that is characterized by being simple and entertaining.

I (owner of this project) have been playing HaxBall for about 3-4 years and it has become one of my favorite games due to its entertaining gameplay and community.

However, unfortunately, during my time playing, I have noticed that HaxBall does not receive constant updates, whether to fix bugs or add new content to the game, although Basro has always been aware of the community about it. The reason for this may be that the game's creator (Mario Carbajal, better known as Basro) does not want to update the game for various personal reasons. It's understandable that he may have other projects besides this one, since HaxBall was a hobby/uni project for him. The game was created 14 years ago. I understand if he has lost motivation or just wants HaxBall to run its course. I guess he must have other projects.

The reason why I decided to start this project is because I feel that HaxBall only survives thanks to its community, the players who have created leagues, Discord servers, maps, rooms, etc. It is absolutely necessary to receive updates so that the game does not become repetitive and boring.

For this reason, I have in mind to create a game totally similar to HaxBall in its physics, gameplay, interface and more, but with the idea of ​​being more constant with updates. I want to create a more community-focused project that receives updates and makes the community feel heard. Since nowadays it is difficult to receive a response from Basro.
